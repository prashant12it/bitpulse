                        when they are going online first time or when they want to hire someone new who can solve their
                        problem and deliver the website and app as they have expected on time.</p>

                        If you’ve hired a person or web development company, they provide you the solution(website and
                        app) and gives support about 3–6 months. What will happen after that if you face any issue or
                        your website and app crashed? Do you pay again for the same or repeat the hiring process again
                        because nobody will give you the assurance that this will never happen again.

                    <h4 class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32"><span class="fw-semibold">3. The most important one is how much the solution(websites and apps) will be secured so that my customers’ data will remain safe?</span>

                    <p class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32">Always trust what you see and choose only when you’re
                        fully satisfied. Most of the times the app and websites crashed later on because they were
                        developed using outdated or old technologies. So <span class="fw-semibold">always ask for the technology stack that company or developer is going to use to develop your website and app</span>,
                        note it down and google the pros and cons of those technology stacks.</p>
                    <p class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32">Ask the developers/company, how the website and app
                        give a better user experience to the customers? Note their answers and compare them with yours.
                        Your answers for the same are:</p>

                    <h4 class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32">1. Users always like the site that load quickly no
                        matter how fast and slow internet speed he is using. So <span class="fw-semibold">your website must load quickly even on slow internet speed.</span>

                    <h4 class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32">2. Your <span class="fw-semibold">website must be lightweight</span>
                        i.e. minimum size (max 2–3MB). Lesser the size of the site faster will be its loading time. Your
                        site does not eat up the user data.
                    </h4>
                    <h4 class="tbk__subtitle fw-vthin fs-18 lh-32">3. Your <span class="fw-semibold">website and app must be responsive</span>
